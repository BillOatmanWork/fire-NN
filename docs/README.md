**Fire 8.NN.MC.3 (NNUE - MCTS/UCT) is now available**

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FireFather/fire-NN/master/docs/Fire_8.NN.MCx64.png)

Fire 8.NN.MC has undergone meticulous analysis and refactoring using many of the most modern C++ tools available today, including Clang, ReSharper C++, and Visual Studio Code Analysis, ensuring the production of extremely fast highly optimized and stable executables.


## available binaries
- **x64 avx2** = fast pgo binary (for modern 64-bit systems w/ AVX2 instruction set)
- **x64 bmi2** = fast pgo binary (for modern 64-bit systems w/ BMI2 instruction set)
- **x64 popc** = fast pgo binary (for modern 64-bit systems w/ popcount instruction set)

- **windows** : Fire_8.NN.MC.3_x64_bmi2.exe, Fire_8.NN.MC.3_x64_avx2.exe, Fire_8.NN.MC.3_x64_popc.exe
- **linux** :   Fire_8.NN.MC.3_x64_bmi2, Fire_8.NN.MC.3_x64_avx2, Fire_8.NN.MC.3_x64_popc

Be aware that, due to lack of avx2 instruction set, the popc binaries are much much slower than the bmi2 and/or avx2 binaries.

Run 'bench' at command line to determine which binary runs best/fastest on your system. for greater accuracy, run it twice and calculate the average of both results.


please see **http://chesslogik.wix.com/fire** for more info

## compile it yourself
- **windows** (visual studio) use included project files: Fire.vcxproj or Fire.sln
- **minGW** run one of the included bash shell scripts: makefire_bmi2.sh, makefire_axv2.sh or makefire_popc.sh
- **ubuntu** type 'make profile-build ARCH=x86-64-bmi2' or 'make profile-build ARCH=x86-64-avx2' or 'make profile-build ARCH=x86-64-popc'

## uci options
- **Hash** size of the hash table. default is 64 MB.
- **Threads** number of processor threads to use. default is 1, max = 128.
- **MultiPV** number of pv's/principal variations (lines of play) to be output. default is 1.
- **Contempt** higher contempt resists draws.
- **MoveOverhead** Adjust this to compensate for network and GUI latency. This is useful to avoid losses on time.
- **MinimumTime** Absolute minimum time (in ms) to spend on a single move. Also useful to avoid losses on time.
- **Ponder** also think during opponent's time. default is false.
- **UCI_Chess960** play chess960 (often called FRC or Fischer Random Chess). default is false.
- **Clear Hash** clear the hash table. delete allocated memory and re-initialize.
- **SyzygyProbeDepth** engine begins probing at specified depth. increasing this option makes the engine probe less.
- **EngineMode** choose NNUE (default), or random.
- **MCTS** enable Monte Carlo Tree Search w/UCT (Upper Confidence Bounds Applied to Trees)
- **SyzygyProbeLimit** number of pieces that have to be on the board in the endgame before the table-bases are probed.
- **Syzygy50MoveRule** set to false, tablebase positions that are drawn by the 50-move rule will count as a win or loss.
- **SyzygyPath** path to the syzygy tablebase files.
- **NnueEvalFile** path to the NNUE evaluation file.

## acknowledgements
many of the ideas & techiques incorporated into Fire are documented in detail here
- [Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org)

and some have been adapted from the super strong open-source chess engine

- [Gull](https://github.com/FireFather/seagull)

the endgame table bases are implemented using code adapted from Ronald de Man's
- [Syzygy EGTBs & probing code](https://github.com/syzygy1/tb)

The NNUE implementation utilizes a modified version of Daniel Shaw's/Cfish excellent nnue probe code:
- [nnue-probe](https://github.com/dshawul/nnue-probe/)

Fire includes 'Raptor', a top reinforcement learning network trained by Sergio Vieri
- https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~sergio-v/nnue/
(rename any downloaded net -> nn.bin and place it in the same directory as the Fire_8.NN.MC.3_x64 executable.)

the MCTS implementation is derived from Stephane Nicolet's work
- https://github.com/snicolet/Stockfish/commits/montecarlo

the quiescent search positions for the tuner have been generously shared by
- [Zurichess](https://bitbucket.org/zurichess/zurichess/src/master/)

## Does Fire play like Stockfish? 
No. Here are the results of Don Daily's SIM program (default values) today to measure Fire 8.NN move selection vs the last 4 versions of Stockfish:

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FireFather/fire-NN/master/docs/matrix.png)

As you can see Stockfish 14.1 and Stockfish 15 make the same moves ~64% of the time (see row 4, column 5)
Fire 8.NN has an excellent score of ~43.34 % (see row 1), making different moves that SF almost 60% of the time.
